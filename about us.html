                    <h2>The story behind Refugee Pal</h2>
                        <p>Did you know that Refugee Pal started off as a science project? In January of 2023, we were tasked with coming up with an innovation for the upcoming science fair at our school. Many ideas came, and were promptly discarded when they proved to be not good enough.</p>
                            
                        <p>However, we ended up settling on Refugee Pal. We both wanted to help refugees who had been forced to leave their homes because of violence. When arriving in Canada, refugees face many difficulties getting the help they need. They lost their social connections, their job certificates, their homes and even their families. Ali came up with an app that would make refugees' lives better. We partnered up, and Refugee Pal was born.</p>

                    <h3><time datetime="2023-01-16">Jan 16</time> - The Year of the Bunny</h3>
                    <p>After the successful ISSofBC interview where we finally figured out which features to add to this website, we parted ways. While Ali got warm at the McDonalds around the corner, I spotted a bunny peeking out of a bush right outside the ISSofBC office. Unfortunately, we later realized that we forgot to take a photo of ourselves at ISSofBC. If you need proof, consult the bunny.</p>
